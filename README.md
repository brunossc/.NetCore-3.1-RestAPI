# .NetCore 3.1 RestAPI Template
 .NetCore 3.1 RestAPI IDE: VSCode

 This is my new study output, in it I did a RestApi(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE and PATCH) and Im using: DDD structure for projects(splited for concerns), .Net core 3.1, Asysnc \ Await, EntityFramework with SQL Database and AutoMapper, I did a end to end with "Cliente" Entity. I leave the "Agenda" Entity for you do, the purpouse of that is you could understand how this works. feel free for get as a template for your projects.
